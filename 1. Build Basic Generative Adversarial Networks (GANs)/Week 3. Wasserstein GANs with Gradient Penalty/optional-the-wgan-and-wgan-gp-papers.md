# (Optional) The WGAN and WGAN-GP Papers

Interested in the papers behind the Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) you just implemented? Check them out! The first paper is the original WGAN paper and the second proposes GP (as well as weight clipping) to WGAN in order to enforce 1-Lipschitz continuity and improve stability.
